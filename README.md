# Divistock-Proof-of-Concept
Proof of Concept or MVP for the Divistock startup.


This is the first installation of the smart loan.

In this commit, a user can begin to select the parameters for his loan. Example a term and the type of coin he wishes to deposit.
He can then send the amount specified to the contract.
When he does a transfer to the contract, this will be used as collateral for his loan.

More breakthrough is expected in the coming days
