Divistock aims to connect the business world by developing a decentralized blockchain that will
allow for anyone or entity; such as companies, individuals, organizations, etc.; to create a
security token on our blockchain that will be bound to an individual asset or a “tokenized asset”.
This is the solution for the gap between non-crypto assets and the blockchain technology. With
this, any asset will be able to be traded, sent and received as easily as it is to send any other
cryptocurrency. This will also mean the decentralization of the assets, no longer will there have
to be any third party for traded assets back and forth, or at least a token representing contractual
claim of an asset. The possibility for tokenizing assignable contractual agreements that do not
involve an underlying asset exists as well (ones that do are known as financial assets).

We plan to create our own platform for Divistock based upon a front-end application that utilizes
our independent blockchain network. The blockchain will be completely decentralized and open
source, so creating a token on the blockchain will be very simple where no development
experience will be required. Any asset will be able to be tokenized with just a few clicks and
forms.
